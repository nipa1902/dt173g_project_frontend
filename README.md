# dt173g_project_frontend
This is the front-end portion for the project course in DT173G. 

The link at the bottom of this readme will take you to the project folder. Each part of the project is hosted seperately and communicates via Fetch API. The project is hosted in three catalogues on my MIUN student website.

## Install

Clone the project, navigate to frontend folder, and run npm install. Then run "gulp" via terminal to deploy a local build. The website will automatically launch via BrowserSync on localhost. 

## Front End

The front end is constructed using GULP and SASS. This repo contains the src files needed to build a deployment of the front-end.

A live version of the website (only pub folder) can be found at:
